We are developing a framework to assess and improve the privacy and security of mobile health applications (apps) that collect and use personal health data.
These apps, commonly used on smartphones and smart devices, have the potential to greatly improve access to healthcare.
However, there are concerns about the privacy and protection of the sensitive user data they collect and generate.
We recognize the need for a user-centered approach that ensures compliance with privacy regulations, enhances clarity in legal documents and app descriptions, and incorporates privacy and security measures during the app design process.

**Our goal is to provide users with more control over their personal data while using health apps and to establish a framework that guides app developers in creating safe and transparent applications.**

This includes the design and development of
- models that are able to automatically infer app permissions from textual descriptions with higher accuracy and lower annotation costs than previous approaches; and
- a global model for privacy best-practices informed by major privacy regulations across four continents, and a comprehensive measurement framework for detecting privacy violations and discrepancies between declared and actual data collection behaviors in mobile health apps.

##### **Broader Impact**
The project's broader significance and importance lie in safeguarding user privacy and security in the increasingly prevalent use of health apps, which handle sensitive personal data.
By addressing regulatory compliance, improving clarity in legal documents, and enhancing app design processes, this research ensures that users have control over their data and can make informed decisions. Ultimately, it promotes trust in health apps, encourages responsible development, and contributes to the advancement of privacy protection in the digital healthcare landscape.

##### **Technical Approach**
The technical approach of this research involves developing natural language processing models capable of cross-genre entailment and inference, connecting the semantics of legal language to technical specifications in software design and development.

##### **Outcomes**
The outcomes of this research include better tools to protect your personal information when using mobile apps, helping ensure that health and fitness apps are transparent about what data they collect and actually follow through on their privacy promises.
Overall, it promotes user safety and privacy in the use of health applications.
