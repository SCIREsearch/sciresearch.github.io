#### Overview

Changes in the meaning of information as it passes through cyberspace can mislead those who access the information.
This project developed new datasets and algorithms to identify and categorize medical information that remains true to the original meaning or undergoes distortion.
Instead of imposing an external `true`/`false` label on information, this project looked into a series of changes within the news coverage itself that gradually lead to a deviation from the original claims.
Identifying important differences between original articles and news stories is a challenging venture with a significant risk-reward tradeoff.
Broader impacts of this work include benefits to the research community by making novel contributions to understanding temporal changes in natural language information, as well as social benefits in the form of improved informational tools like question-answering.
For the medical domain in particular, understanding temporal distortions and deviations from actual medical findings can reduce occurrences of harmful health choices, for instance, by embedding the research outcomes in news, social media, or search engines.

This research went beyond contemporary approaches limited to `true`/`false` labels, and avoided the potential biases imposed by external fact-checkers.
Instead, it explored information change in narratives, including semantic changes and nuances, or selective emphasis of related information.
