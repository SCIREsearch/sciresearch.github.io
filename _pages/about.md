**SCIRE** (Latin: *to know*) explores and advances the frontiers of computational linguistics and its applications in
contemporary society, designing and developing machine learning algorithms and models that promise unprecedented
comprehension of natural language pragmatics. We investigate social problems expressed using human language, especially
problems that rely on a careful analysis of context beyond the immediate linguistic neighborhood of such expressions,
including the use of figurative language, e.g., fallacious argumentation by means of deflection, the use of subtle bias,
and the use of perceptions created through rhetoric and dialectic maneuvers. Pushing these boundaries may enable rich
applications across multiple domains such as computational journalism, representation learning, communication theory,
healthcare informatics, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval. To develop these cutting-edge AI
technology vectors, our research lies at the intersection of computational linguistics, machine learning, sociology,
and psychology. 

The core research areas of SCIRE Lab are: natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social science, which are explored through foundational theories in sociology, psychology, mathematics, and linguistics.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
