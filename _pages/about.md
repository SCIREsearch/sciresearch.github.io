### OUR MISSION

**SCIRE** (Latin: "to know") explores and advances the frontiers of computational linguistics and its applications in
contemporary society, designing and developing machine learning algorithms and models that promise unprecedented
comprehension of natural language pragmatics. We investigate social problems expressed using human language, especially
problems that rely on a careful analysis of context beyond the immediate linguistic neighborhood of such expressions,
including the use of figurative language, e.g., fallacious argumentation by means of deflection, the use of subtle bias,
and the use of perceptions created through rhetoric and dialectic maneuvers. Pushing these boundaries may enable rich
applications across multiple domains such as computational journalism, representation learning, communication theory,
healthcare informatics, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval. To develop these cutting-edge AI
technology vectors, our research lies at the intersection of computational linguistics, machine learning, sociology,
and psychology. 

Our core research areas are natural language processing, machine learning, and computational argumentation, which are explored through foundational theories in sociology, psychology, mathematics, and linguistics.
